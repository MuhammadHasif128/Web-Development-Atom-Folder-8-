can be in body and head (script)

execute head first then body

document.write (write output to browser)

python no need define data DOCTYPE

javascript need to allocate cuz they need to know the resources to allocate

hasif = 5 bytes (ascii value)

inspect > console = debugging javascript

anyth defined at head, GLOBAL Variable

once u put a variable in a function, IT BELONGS TO A FUNCTION alert

Fuction executes a task

function = name(paremeter) = return value, call out

always type script first

function is like loop. can do many times, but need to call out. Like calculator. can call more than two times add(); add();

return, need data back

during hol, do javascript lab, and prompt user, we code for u
